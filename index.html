            <h1><span class="orange">Benefits</span> of Healthy Food</h1>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Healthy food does not have merely one but numerous benefits. It helps us in various spheres of life.
                Healthy food does not only impact our physical health but mental health too.</p>

            <p>When we intake healthy fruits and vegetables that are full of nutrients, we reduce the chances of
                diseases. For instance, green vegetables help us to maintain strength and vigor. In addition, certain
                healthy food items keep away long-term illnesses like diabetes and blood pressure.</p>
            <p>Similarly, obesity is the biggest problems our country is facing now. People are falling prey to obesity
                faster than expected. However, this can still be controlled. Obese people usually indulge in a lot of
                junk food. The junk food contains sugar, salt fats and more which contribute to obesity. Healthy food
                can help you get rid of all this as it does not contain harmful things.</p>

        <p class="center">Healthy food refers to food that contains the right amount of nutrients to keep our body fit.
            We need healthy
            food to keep ourselves fit.</p>
        <p class="center">Furthermore, healthy food is also very delicious as opposed to popular thinking. Nowadays,
            kids need to eat
            healthy food more than ever. <br> We must encourage good eating habits so that our future generations will
            be
            healthy and fit.</p>
        <p class="center">A proverb says- <q> <span class="orange">WHEN DIET IS WRONG, MEDICINE IS OF NO USE. WHEN DIET
                    IS CORRECT, MEDICINE IS OF NO
                    NEED.</span></q></p>
